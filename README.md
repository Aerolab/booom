Booom is a Chrome Extension for Dribbble.com we developed at [Aerolab](https://aerolab.co), which adds multiple features that make life easier for designers. Features include:

* Bigger, High Resolution Shots in lists
* Like and Add to Bucket buttons in lists
* Infinite Scrolling
* GIFs autoplay in lists
* Shots always open in @2x
* Better support for bigger screens
* Better Add to Bucket UI


# Developing for the Extension

Go to [chrome://extensions/](chrome://extensions/), enable Developer Mode and click on Load Unpacked Extension. Pick the folder in which you clones this repo and that's about it. You need to reload the extension after each change, or you can add an extension that reloads everything automatically.

The extension is standard HTML, JS and CSS built on top of [Dribbble](https://dribbble.com).
